### Clean Code :) 

#### [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasonroell600-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkId=0f6366550007e76e1b7d400fa829f90f)

Even bad code can function. But if code isn t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn t have to be that way. 

#### [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jasonroell600-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0201485672&linkId=273488cbe8d54d8ad4441197e5326762)

As the application of object technology--particularly the Java programming language--has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. 

#### [The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride](https://www.amazon.de/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501)

Despite advanced tools and methodologies, software projects continue to fail. Why? Too many organizations still view software development as just another production line. Too many developers feel that way, too—and they behave accordingly.

#### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://books.google.bg/books/about/Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code.html?id=CQlRAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y&hl=en)

What is legacy code? I've used the term without defining it. Let's look at the strict definition: Legacy code is code that we've gotten from someone else. Maybe our company acquired code from another company; maybe people on the original team moved on to other projects. Legacy code is somebody else's code. But in programmer-speak, the term means much more than that. The termlegacy codehas taken on more shades of meaning and more weight over time.

#### [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321503627&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2)

"The authors of this book have led a revolution in the craft of programming by controlling the environment in which software grows.” --Ward Cunningham

 “At last, a book suffused with code that exposes the deep symbiosis between TDD and OOD. This one's a keeper.” --Robert C. Martin

“If you want to be an expert in the state of the art in TDD, you need to understand the ideas in this book.”--Michael Feathers

### Design patterns

#### [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.de/Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-Software/dp/0201633612)

Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.

#### [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are both exciting and a fascinating topic to explore in any programming language.

One reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're attempting to solve.

#### [Implementation Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=MBXHNZNG3799SBB1Y7GH)

“Kent is a master at creating code that communicates well, is easy to understand, and is a pleasure to read. Every chapter of this book contains excellent explanations and insights into the smaller but important decisions we continuously have to make when creating quality code and classes.”

–Erich Gamma, IBM Distinguished Engineer 

### Test Driven Development

#### [The Art of Unit Testing: with Examples in .NET](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988274/ref=x_gr_w_bb?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1933988274&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2) 

### Microservices

#### [Building Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do)

Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. 

#### [Building Microservices with ASP.NET Core: Develop, Test, and Deploy Cross-Platform Services in the Cloud](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-ASP-NET-Core-Cross-Platform-ebook/dp/B0758YB73N/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me)

At a time when nearly every vertical, regardless of domain, seems to need software running in the cloud to make money, microservices provide the agility and drastically reduced time to market you require. This hands-on guide shows you how to create, test, compile, and deploy microservices, using the ASP.NET Core free and open-source framework. Along the way, you’ll pick up good, practical habits for building powerful and robust services.
